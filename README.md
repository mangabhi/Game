Today, graphics are a key defining feature of most games. While 2D graphics used to be the norm for games released through the mid-1990s, most AAA games now boast full 3D graphics, even for games which are largely 2D in nature, such as Civilization III. However, purely 2D graphics have experienced a Renaissance with indie games.[13]
